# A script to update MarkLogic home and data directory symlinks.
# This is useful for switching between multiple releases.
# The script assumes version numbers are appended to the end of the directory name separated by an underscore (_).
# It also assumes that the version numbers are the same on the home and data directories (e.g. _4.2-3.2 in both places).
# CAUTION: There are some checks to make sure it's not deleting data, but test it out somewhere safe first
# DISCLAIMER: This is not condoned or supported by MarkLogic Support or Engineering.
#
#
# Usage:
# ./ml.sh
# 
# Returns the current configuration
# App    /Users/username/Library/MarkLogic_5.0-x
# Data   /Users/username/Library/Application Support/MarkLogic/Data_5.0-x
#
# ./ml.sh 4.2-2
#
# Updates the symlinks using the version parameter and outputs the updated config 
#
# Stopping MarkLogic…
# Switched active server to:
# App    /Users/jmakeig/Library/MarkLogic_4.2-2
# Data   /Users/jmakeig/Library/Application Support/MarkLogic/Data_4.2-2
#
# ./ml.sh --unlink
# ./ml.sh -u
#
# Unlinks the existing softlinks. This is useful in preparation for a fresh install.
